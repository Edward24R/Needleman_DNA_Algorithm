Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm, .csv input and output

-First row of the input and result .csv file is used as a header for classification such as:
 sequence1, sequence2.

-To run code, initiate the program by going to the command prompt or python terminal, and inside
 your chosen directory type:
                            py read_write_main.py inputFileName.csv

 (Input file must be in the same directory as program file)

-This will create a result.csv file with the algorithm's results of the input file data.
